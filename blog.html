          <br /><br />Here is a great weeknight dinner that comes together on
          the stove in just under 20 minutes. Soft, sticky and flavor-packed
          aubergine meets crunchy broccoli and earthy noodles. Heaven in a bowl.

          These cookies from Aran Goyoaga new cookbook are naturally gluten-free
          with a delicious hint of fennel. We also made them vegan. Try the
          cookies and read our conversation with Aran.

          This is an untraditional but delicious take on Shakshuka with a sweet
          potato base and crunchy roasted sweet potato skin on top. The recipe
          is from the new book Shelf Love from Ottolenghi Test Kitchen.

          The star of this Vegan Caesar Salad is the oyster mushrooms that we
          sear using a special pressing method that makes it umami-rich and
          crunchy on the outside while juicy and flavor-packed inside.

        WHAT'S NEW Hello and welcome. We started Green Kitchen Stories back in
        2009! — and the site has basically not changed at all since the very
        beginning. But after years of talking about a redesign, we finally got
        it done. This is Green Kitchen Stories 2.0 and we are really happy with
        how it has turned out. There is a new and totally improved recipe
        archive where you can see preview images of all the recipes and scroll
        or filter the categories. A Life & Travel section where we have gathered
        some of our travel guides and photos and posts about the kids. A much
        improved book section and a new video section. We will also be adding a
        shop later on that we are very excited about! Hope you will enjoy the
        new site! Big love!<br /><br />

        We love green pancakes (aka spinach crêpes) in our family and are
        constantly exploring more ways to incorporate them into various meals.

        These colorful flatbreads are quick to make, have only 3 ingredients
        (well kind of, if you are not counting salt or pepper) with the main
        one...

        They are great in a burger bun, but most of the time we add them to

        15 Tips for Traveling with young kids. We wrote this guide after having
        traveled six months in the US and Asia together with our daughter Elsa,
        who only was six months when we boarded our first plane. Since then, we
        have explored South Africa, Morocco, Australia, New Zealand and Sri
        Lanka with our other kids and have learned a few tricks how to keep them
        happy, calm and safe.
