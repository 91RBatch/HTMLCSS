            Vijayawada: Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan on Wednesday condemned the attack on a priest of Lord Someswara at Bhimavaram, one of the Pancharama temples.

In a statement, he charged that YSRC leader and Temple Trust Board chairperson’s husband Yugandhar had attacked the assistant priest Pandrangi Nagendra Pawan of the temple and wantonly broke the Yagnopaveetham (sacred thread) worn by the priest.

Demanding stern action against the YSRC leader, Pawan Kalyan said the highhanded act is unjustifiable and unforgivable, especially when the person targeted is involved in serving God in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple.

The JS chief vowed to submit a report to centre listing how several Hindu temples have been targeted in the state and failure of the state government to act against perpetrators of such attacks.

<h1 class="h1">Rajinikant's Success Streak Continues Unabated as Global Frenzy Surrounds Jailer</h1>
<p class="p">Lights, camera, Rajinikanth! The legendary superstar, Rajinikanth, remains an age-defying force as he maintains his supreme reign in the hearts of fans across the globe. The much-anticipated release of Jailer has sparked an electrifying frenzy, further solidifying Rajinikanth's unparalleled impact. From skyrocketing search trends to unprecedented box office bookings, Rajinikanth's influence continues to shape the entertainment landscape.

    Amidst the passage of time, one constant remains—the unwavering devotion of Rajinikanth's fan base. The digital sphere has witnessed an unprecedented surge in search activity leading up to the grand premiere. Google Trends hit a perfect score of 100 around 10:30 pm. This peak score symbolizes the pinnacle of search interest and attests to the global fascination surrounding the superstar.
    
    Speaking of global fascination, Singapore emerged as the frontrunner in search interest, securing a flawless score of 100. This fervour extended to other regions, with Sri Lanka (96), Qatar (83), United Arab Emirates (82), and Bahrain (78) all being captivated by Rajinikanth's aura. Strikingly, India, the heartland of his fandom, secured the sixth spot with an average score of 74 in the preceding week. This exemplifies Rajinikanth's universal allure that transcends boundaries and cultures.
    
    Turning our attention to the domestic landscape, it's no surprise that the southern regions of India remain ablaze with Rajinikanth's fervour. The ardour is palpable, with Karnataka leading the way, closely followed by Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. However, Tamil Nadu's approach to displaying their admiration took an interesting turn. While one might expect the state to dominate online excitement, it was revealed that a significant portion of moviegoers in Tamil Nadu opted for a more traditional approach: purchasing tickets offline, directly from the theaters.
    
    Upon delving into city-specific trends, the spotlight falls on five pivotal Indian cities. Out of the 178 cities registering a Google Trends value of 50 or more (indicating the movie's remarkable popularity), Pirancheri led the pack with a perfect score of 100. Thailavaram, Umamahesharapuram, Kurinjipadi, and Villianur followed closely with scores ranging from 88 to 95. These figures underscore the widespread appeal of "Jailer" across the Indian map.
    
    And let's not overlook the international following that Rajinikanth commands. Palani, Siruseri, Kumbakonam, Cuddalore, and Tiruvallur took the lead overseas, all achieving scores exceeding 90. A notable revelation: all 64 cities with scores above 50 were located within India, further cementing the superstar's stronghold on his home turf.</p>
